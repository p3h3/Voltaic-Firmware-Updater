# Voltaic Firmware Updater

This is a tool for updating both VoltaicBMS and VoltaicTacho Firmware over the air.

It's going to be integrated into the Interface soon, for now it is a separate tool though.

The usage is simple:

1. Connect your device
2. Select your desired firmware version in the "available images" dropdown
3. load the image with the "load image" button
4. make sure your board has a stable power connection as powerloss during the update may cause serious issues!
5. start the upload process and get a coffe.. it takes a while ;)
